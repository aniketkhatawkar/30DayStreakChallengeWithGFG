Smallest window in a string containing all the characters of another string

Given two strings s and p. Find the smallest window in the string s consisting of all the characters(including duplicates) of the string p.  
Return "-1" in case there is no such window present. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index.
Note : All characters are in Lowercase alphabets. 

Examples:

Input: s = "timetopractice", p = "toc"
Output: toprac
Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest
substring in which "toc" can be found.
