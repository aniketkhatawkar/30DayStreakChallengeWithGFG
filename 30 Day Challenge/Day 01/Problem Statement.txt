Array to BST

Given a sorted array. Convert it into a Height Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). 
Return the root of the BST.

Height-balanced BST means a binary tree in which the depth of the left subtree and the right subtree of every node never differ by more than 1.

Note: The driver code will check the BST, 
if it is a Height-balanced BST, the output will be true otherwise the output will be false.
