Maximize The Cut Segments

Given an integer n denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum. Return the maximum number of cut segments possible.

Note: if no segment can be cut then return 0.

Examples:

Input: n = 4, x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Total length is 4, and the cut
lengths are 2, 1 and 1.  We can make
maximum 4 segments each of length 1.
