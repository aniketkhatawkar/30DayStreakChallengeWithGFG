Sum Tree

Given a Binary Tree. Check for the Sum Tree for every node except the leaf node. 
Return true if it is a Sum Tree otherwise, return false.

A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. 
An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as the sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered a Sum Tree.

Examples :

Input:
    3
  /   \    
 1     2
Output: true
Explanation: The sum of left subtree and right subtree is 1 + 2 = 3, 
which is the value of the root node. Therefore,the given binary tree is a sum tree.
