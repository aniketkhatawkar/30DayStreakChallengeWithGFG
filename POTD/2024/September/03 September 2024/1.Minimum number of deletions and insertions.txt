Minimum number of deletions and insertions

Given two strings str1 and str2. The task is to remove or insert the minimum number of characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. 
It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.

Examples :

Input: str1 = "heap", str2 = "pea"
Output: 3
Explanation: 2 deletions and 1 insertion.
p and h deleted from heap. Then, p is inserted at the beginning.
One thing to note, though p was required yet it was removed/deleted first from its position and then it is inserted to some other position. 
Thus, p contributes one to the deletion_count and one to the insertion_count.
