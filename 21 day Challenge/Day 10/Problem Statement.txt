Reverse Words

Given a String str, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. 
Words are separated by dots.

Note: The last character has not been '.'. 

Examples :

Input: str = i.like.this.program.very.much
Output: much.very.program.this.like.i
Explanation: After reversing the whole string(not individual words), 
the input string becomes much.very.program.this.like.i
