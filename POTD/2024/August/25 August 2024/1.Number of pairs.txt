Number of pairs

Given two positive integer arrays arr and brr, 
find the number of pairs such that xy > yx (raised to power of) where x is an element from arr and y is an element from brr.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 6], brr[] = [1, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The pairs which follow xy > yx are: 21 > 12,  25 > 52 and 61 > 16
