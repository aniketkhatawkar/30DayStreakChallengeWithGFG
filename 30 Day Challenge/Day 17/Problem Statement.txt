Rotate a Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, 
the task is to rotate the linked list clockwise by k nodes, 
i.e., left-shift the linked list by k nodes, 
where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to length of the linked list.

Examples:

Input: linkedlist: 2->4->7->8->9 , k = 3
Output: 8->9->2->4->7
Explanation:
Rotate 1: 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2
Rotate 2: 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 4
Rotate 3: 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7
